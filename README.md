# JSquiz
My Psuedo code as I work this out
1) Boot Strap for responsive design and page layout
2) Header will contain the quiz title along with printing the running score and timer in each corner. 
3)Body will have the container and bootstrap elements:
    Start button: starts the 75 seconds. (with 10 seconds taken off with each wrong answer)
    Timmer wrapped around the below elements
        questions 1-5 with button selections
        If answer has a true match give one point and continue on to next question. 
        When false: timmer goes down by 10 seconds
        Need a point counter that adds with each true answer.
